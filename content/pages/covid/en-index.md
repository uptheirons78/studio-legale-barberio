We receive daily questions from our clients about the possibility or not to renew their **expiring residency permits**. Any residency permit is now **extended till the 15 of June 2020** and **there will be the possibility of a renewal application only after that date**.

Rules actually in force:

**Article n. 103 paragraph 1 of Legislative Decree 18/20** provides the following rules regarding the issue and renewal of residency permits: _"for the purpose of calculating preliminary, peremptory, end-procedural, final and executive deadlines or terms relating the performance of administrative procedures at the request of a party or office, pending on February 23, 2020 or started after that date, it is NOT taken into account of the period between the same date and that of April 15, 2020. Public Administrations adopt every organizational measure suitable to ensure in any case a reasonable duration and a fast conclusion of the procedures, with priority for those to be considered urgent, also on the basis of motivated requests of the concerned. The terms of formation of the final will of the administration in the forms of significant silence provided by our legislative system are extended or deferred for the corresponding time"_.

Paragraph n. 2 establishes that _"Any kind of certificates, certifications, permits, concessions, authorizations and qualifying documents however called, expiring between 31 January 2020 and 15 April 2020, **are valid until 15 June 2020**"_.

As clarified by the 21 March 2020 circular n. 23308 issued by the Interior Minister, **ALL RESIDENCE PERMITS EXPIRED BETWEEN 31 JANUARY AND 15 APRIL 2020 ARE EXTENDED UNTIL 15 JUNE 2020 GIVING THE POSSIBILITY TO THE HOLDERS TO BE ABLE TO PERFORM A RENEWAL APPLICATION AFTER THIS DATE**.
